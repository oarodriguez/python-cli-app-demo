# [python-demo-cli-app]

Demonstrate how to build a Command Line Interface application using Python.

## Installation of dependencies

Dependencies are managed by [poetry], so it should be installed in the system. You should use poetry
`1.2.2` or later, since the `poetry.lock` file format is compatible with those versions only. Then,
in the project root directory, execute

```shell
poetry install
```

Poetry will take care of the installation process. Afterward, the project packages and command-line
interface tools should be available in the current shell. It is recommended to create a separate
virtual environment for this project.
